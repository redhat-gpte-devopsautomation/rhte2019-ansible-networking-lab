= Ansible Networking Automation

== Part 3: Reconfigure the Routers to connect 2 sites

=== Part 3 Overview

- Use a Playbook with `ios_config` to create a GRE Tunnel
- Use a Playbook with various networking modules to configure routing
- Use `ios_config` to restore routers using the backups you created
- Create a `site.yml` to automate all previous stages into a single Playbook

== Setup a GRE Tunnel connecting the 2 sites

FinTech's Security guidelines mandate all site to site communications must be
encapsulated in a tunnel across all public networks. In this step you will
recreate the GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel that was in place prior
to the attack on the routers.

If successful you will have completed the first part of re-establishing communications between the 2 sites.

. Start to create the GRE Tunnel Playbook
+
.. Create a new playbook `gre.yml` in your editor of choice (`vim`, `emacs`, and
`nano` installed)
+
.. Write the header section to configure the two routers, turning of the
  unnecessary gather_facts :
+
----

---
- name: Configure GRE Tunnel between rtr1 and rtr2
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: no
  connection: network_cli
----
.. Add in variables to hold the *public* addresses for the the 2 Cisco routers.
We again use hostvars for this, gathering it from the inventory. *Hostvars* allow
up to access meta-data about our inventory hosts. In the snippet below we
extract the `ansible_host` IP addresses for the 2 routers. Add this to your
`gre.yml` playbook.
+
----
vars:
  rtr1_public_ip: "{{ hostvars['rtr1']['ansible_host'] }}"
  rtr2_public_ip: "{{ hostvars['rtr2']['ansible_host'] }}"
----

.. Now we need to create the GRE tunnel end-points on each of the two routers by
executing a similar task on each _individual_ router. Each router binds an IP
address on a *different* subnet on each site to an external facing interface. These IP addresses wil become the 2 end-points of our GRE Tunnel. In this case
`GigabitEthernet1`.
+
The `ios_config` module is used here to configure the router.
+
----
  tasks:

  - name: create tunnel interface to R2
    ios_config:
      lines:
       - 'ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0'
       - 'tunnel source GigabitEthernet1'
       - 'tunnel destination {{ rtr2_public_ip }}'
      parents: interface Tunnel 0
    when: '"rtr1" in inventory_hostname'

  - name: create tunnel interface to R1
    ios_config:
      lines:
       - 'ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0'
       - 'tunnel source GigabitEthernet1'
       - 'tunnel destination {{ rtr1_public_ip }}'
      parents: interface Tunnel 0
    when: '"rtr2" in inventory_hostname'
----
+
. Your resulting `gre.yml` playbook should look like this
+
----

---
- name: Configure GRE Tunnel between rtr1 and rtr2
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: no
  connection: network_cli

  vars:
    rtr1_public_ip: "{{ hostvars['rtr1']['ansible_host'] }}"
    rtr2_public_ip: "{{ hostvars['rtr2']['ansible_host'] }}"

  tasks:

  - name: create tunnel interface to R2
    ios_config:
      lines:
       - 'ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0'
       - 'tunnel source GigabitEthernet1'
       - 'tunnel destination {{ rtr2_public_ip }}'
      parents: interface Tunnel 0
    when: '"rtr1" in inventory_hostname'

  - name: create tunnel interface to R1
    ios_config:
      lines:
       - 'ip address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0'
       - 'tunnel source GigabitEthernet1'
       - 'tunnel destination {{ rtr1_public_ip }}'
      parents: interface Tunnel 0
    when: '"rtr2" in inventory_hostname'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
YAML is very sensitive to correct indentation, make sure your resulting playbook
matches the above.
====
+
[TIP]
====
There where multiple ways of implementing the above playbook where specific tasks
or groups of tasks execute against specific hosts. For example we could have used 2 playbooks with one
for each.

Here we used a single playbook with `when:` to ensure the specific task is
only applied to the specific router. Take a moment to look at each of the `when:`
statements.
====
+
If the FinTech engagement grows in the future and you have more time with the client
this is a good candidate for a role having a well defined scope with a high
possibility of re-use. In a longer engagement this would almost certainly be the more optimal approach.
+
. Run the playbook
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook gre.yml
----
+
This should complete without errors.
+
Ping the private address of the remote server `backend`
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ping backend
----
+
.. This still fails, because whilst we have a GRE Tunnel no routing yet exists on either the routers themselves or the servers.
+
----
PING backend (172.17.0.45) 56(84) bytes of data.
--- backend ping statistics ---
15 packets transmitted, 0 received, 100% packet loss, time 13999ms

----


You now need to configure routing between the 2 routers to complete the connectivity between the 2 sites.

== Setup Routing Between the 2 Sites

Access to the server `backend`, and the application, has almost been re-established. You have re-established the tunnel between the 2 sites, now you need to configure the routers to send the appropriate traffic across this
connection.

. Create a new playbook `router-config.yml`, start with creating the header
  section.

+
----

---
- name: Router Configurations
  hosts: routers
  gather_facts: no
  connection: network_cli
  vars:
    ansible_network_os: ios
    dns_servers:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 8.8.4.4
    host1_private_ip: "{{ hostvars['host1']['private_ip'] }}"
    control_private_ip: "{{ hostvars['ansible']['private_ip'] }}"
----
+
. Now create a block for rtr1
+
----
  tasks:

  - name: configure router rtr1
    block:

      - name: Static route from R1 to R2
        ios_static_route:
          prefix: "{{ host1_private_ip }}"
          mask: 255.255.255.255
          next_hop: 10.0.0.2

      - name: configure name servers
        ios_system:
          name_servers: "{{ item }}"
        loop: "{{ dns_servers }}"

    when: '"rtr1" in inventory_hostname'
----

+
[TIP]
====
The `block` statement allows us to group multiple related tasks together, here
we are using it combined with the `when` statement to group tasks together for
`rtr1`.

Notice the use of `loop` to iterate through the 2 values of the `list` variable
`dns_servers`. Prior to Ansible `2.5` we would have had to use `with_items:`.
====

+
. Now insert another block to configure rtr2
+
----

  - name: configure router rtr2
    block:

      - name: enable GigabitEthernet1 interface
        ios_interface:
          name: GigabitEthernet1
          description: interface to host1
          state: present

      - name: dhcp configuration for GigabitEthernet1
        ios_config:
          lines:
            - ip address dhcp
          parents: interface GigabitEthernet1

      - name: Static route from R2 to R1
        ios_static_route:
          prefix: "{{ control_private_ip }}"
          mask: 255.255.255.255
          next_hop: 10.0.0.1

      - name: configure name servers
        ios_system:
          name_servers: "{{ item }}"
        loop: "{{ dns_servers }}"

    when:  '"rtr2" in inventory_hostname'

Again pay attention to indentation etc. Ansible provides a way to validate
syntax before running a playbook. ` ansible-playbook router_config.yml
--syntax-check`

[TIP]
====
This time instead of using a `when:` as we did in our earlier playbooks to isolate each router, here as we
configure the 2 servers `ansible` and `backend` we combine 2 separate playbooks in 1
file.

Both playbook header also lack a `connection:` setting as Ansible by
default assumes an ordinary `ssh` connection.

Finally note the use of `handlers:` which can be used in any playbook whether
targeting servers, network devices, or both. A handler is a special way of
calling a task whenever an action needs to be taken after a previous task. For
example both installing and configuring an application may require a restart.
So a handler would be notified by both tasks but would only run once when the
playbook finishes.
====
+
. Run the new playbook and update both servers routing.
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ansible-playbook host-routes.yml
----
+
. Ping the back-end server again. Occasionally Linux will take a few moments to
  recognize the route so if you see a failure try again after 1-2 minutes.
+
----
[student1@ansible ~]$ ping backend

. Now return to your browser and re-try your application by accessing this
  server.

[NOTE]
====
This is the ansible host you are currently working on
`http://<CONTROL_NODE_IP_ADDRESS`
====

== Success - Congratulations

Whilst the application might not look quite what you expected you have
successfully restored the GRE Tunnel and updated the routers routing
configuration to restore routing. *Perhaps this is not the application you were
looking for?*

Whilst the application engineers can get to work fixing the application itself,
if you have time left over - some stretch goals.

=== Bonus Exercises
Finished, still time on the clock? Chose from one or more of the exercises
below:

==== Convert some, or all, of your playbooks to use `cli_config`

==== Wrap your playbooks in a `site.yml` playbook
As you worked through the lab you executed your playbooks individually

* Create a `site.yml` playbook
* Include each of the key re-configuration playbooks, you will need:
** `banner.yml`
** `gre.yml`
** `router-config.yml`
* *HINT:* `import_playbook:`

==== Explore the changes you made during the lab
Examine your changes. Earlier in the lab you backed up the routers using your
  first playbook:

* Copy away the initial backup files for safe keeping
* Run the `backup.yml` playbook again
* Examine your changes comparing the original and new backups for `rtr` and for
  `rtr2`, (hints: `diff`)

==== Create a new multi-line MOTD
FInTech InfoSec have decided you need a clearer MOTD and have provided a new
  multi-line MOTD:

----
Property of FinTech Inc.
No unauthorized access
Violators will be prosecuted
----

** Update your `banner.yml` playbook to do this.

==== Working with Roles
Create a GRE Tunnel Role: The GRE Tunnel playbook performs one function
  cleanly and naturally lends itself to a role.
Create a Routing role: Setting up routing is a common function and again lends
  itself naturally to a role
